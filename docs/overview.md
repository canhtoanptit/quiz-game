1. System Requirements

2. Architecture Overview
The architecture can be split into several components:

2.1 Client-Server Architecture

Frontend Clients: Web and mobile apps for users (hosts and players) to interact with quizzes.
Backend Servers: A RESTful API backend to handle user requests, quizzes, and real-time game logic.
2.2 Component Design
a. Frontend
Web and Mobile App: Developed with modern frameworks like React (Web), React Native/Flutter (Mobile).
WebSocket Client: To enable real-time interactions (updates, quiz questions, responses, leaderboards).
UI/UX: Should be intuitive, fast, and responsive across different devices (adaptive/responsive design).
b. Backend
Microservices Architecture: Each core feature is built as a separate microservice.

Authentication Service: Handles user authentication (OAuth, JWT tokens for sessions).
Quiz Management Service: CRUD operations on quizzes.
Game Service: Orchestrates live games, tracks questions, responses, scores, and time limits.
Leaderboard Service: Manages the ranking and scoring logic.
Media Service: Stores and serves multimedia content (images, videos) for the quizzes.
Real-Time Communication Service: Uses WebSockets to maintain real-time connections between the host and participants during gameplay.
Notification Service: Sends reminders and updates to users via email, push notifications, or SMS.
c. Database
Relational Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL): Stores structured data like users, quizzes, quiz questions, scores.
NoSQL Database (MongoDB/Redis): Stores session data, quiz responses, and leaderboards for quick access and scalability.
In-Memory Cache (Redis): Caching for low-latency data access (e.g., user sessions, quiz results).
d. Real-Time Communication
WebSocket Servers: To enable real-time communication between the quiz host and players. WebSockets can be used to push quiz questions and leaderboard updates instantaneously to all participants.
Message Queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka): For distributing events like quiz starting, answer processing, and leaderboard updates across servers.
2.3 Scalability and Load Balancing
Horizontal Scaling: Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers. Autoscale based on traffic.
Content Delivery Network (CDN): Store static assets like images and videos on a CDN for faster load times across different regions.
Database Sharding: Distribute the database to handle large amounts of user data and quiz sessions.
2.4 Deployment
Cloud-Based Deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP): Use cloud services to deploy scalable microservices.
Kubernetes/Docker: Containerize microservices for easy management and scaling.
3. Data Flow Diagram (High Level)
User Interaction:

Users (hosts and participants) interact with the system via their web/mobile app.
Hosts can create quizzes, and participants can join quizzes using a session code.
Backend Communication:

The frontend communicates with the backend RESTful APIs for user management, quiz management, and multimedia handling.
Real-Time Gameplay:

The game server orchestrates real-time interactions using WebSockets. It sends questions to participants and receives answers. The server processes the responses and sends back updated scores and leaderboards.
Data Storage:

Quiz and user data are stored in relational databases.
Game session data (e.g., active games, user scores) is stored temporarily in Redis or a similar in-memory database for fast access.
Analytics and Reporting:

Analytics services can process game data and provide insights to hosts about player performance, engagement, etc.
4. Security Considerations
Encryption: Use TLS for secure communication between clients and servers.
Authentication: Use OAuth2 or JWT for secure and scalable user authentication.
DDoS Protection: Implement rate limiting, throttling, and traffic monitoring.
Data Privacy: Ensure compliance with data protection laws like GDPR.
5. Technology Stack
Frontend: React (Web), React Native/Flutter (Mobile)
Backend: Node.js (or Go/Java for high performance), Express.js (API gateway)
Databases: PostgreSQL (RDBMS), MongoDB (NoSQL), Redis (In-memory cache)
Real-Time Communication: WebSockets (Socket.IO)
Queueing: RabbitMQ or Kafka
Cloud: AWS/GCP for infrastructure (Kubernetes for orchestration)
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack for log management, alerting, and metrics
